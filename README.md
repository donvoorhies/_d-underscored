# _d (Underscored)
The repository for my slight variant (or tweak) of the _s-theme ("Underscores" - by Automattic: https://github.com/Automattic/_s), which I've named: _d (as in "Underscored").

Insert (Copy&Paste) the posted CSS in the theme's "Appearance"-section -> "Customize"-section ->"Additional CSS", publish and you're good to go...

Regarding the markdown-file at: https://github.com/donvoorhies/_d-underscored/blob/main/4header_php.md - view the file as RAW to see the alterations and the code needed to be done with the "headers.php"-file
