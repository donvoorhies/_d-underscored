# _d (Underscored)
The repository for my slight variant (or tweak) of the _s-theme ("Underscores" - by Automattic: https://github.com/Automattic/_s), which I've named: _d (as in "Underscored").

Insert (Copy&Paste) the posted CSS in the theme's "Appearance"-section -> "Customize"-section ->"Additional CSS", publish and you're good to go...

Regarding the markdown-file at: https://github.com/donvoorhies/_d-underscored/blob/main/4header_php.md - view the file to see the alterations and the code needed to be done with the "headers.php"-file...

Also add:<b><i>"&lt;div class="push"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;"</i></b> just before the </main>-tag on the following pages:
"index.php", "page.php", "search.php" and "single.php" - for the implementing a sticky-footer on this theme.
